## How to Report Issues or Request New Features

Due to the fact that our software and hardware is under constant development, there is a good chance that you can catch a bug or just a software issues that can and should be fixed; If your issue report is effective, then its chances of getting fixed are significantly higher. So fixing a bug or issue depends upon how effectively it is reported.

We encourage all our users to provide as detailed info as possible about each and every issue they discovered and every feature they are requesting. Please file your reports, questions and request to [support@atomminer.com](mailto:support@atomminer.com)

While we're always excited to hear your ideas and analyze your reports, we should notice that questions like below most likely won't be answered at all or will be put all the way down the priority line. Unfortunately following questions are quoted from the real life support requests we're receiving...

- "I started something and nothing works now. Please help!"
- "yo bro wen update?"
- "it says error what am I doing wrong?"
- "I get more stratum failed timeout but yesterday i shutdown CLI properly and closed terminal"

We're sorry, but we have failed to develop telepathy skills throughout the tech support evolution and don't know what you are doing or what is on your screen...
