# Understanding Mining Payment Models: PROP vs PPS vs PPNL vs DPPS

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency mining, the process of validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain, is a complex task that requires significant computational power. To enhance efficiency and ensure a steady income for miners, many choose to join mining pools. These pools utilize different payment models to distribute rewards among participants. In this article, we'll explore four popular mining pool payment models: PROP, PPS, PPNL, and DPPS.

## PROP (Proportional ) Payment Model

The proportional payment model, often abbreviated as "PROP," allocates rewards based on the proportion of computational power contributed by each miner. Miners earn a share of the block reward corresponding to the number of valid shares they submit. The formula is straightforward: the more shares contributed, the higher the payout.

This model is fair for miners who consistently provide significant computational power, as they are directly rewarded based on their contribution once block is solved by the pool. However, it carries the risk of variance, as miners may go through periods without receiving rewards if the pool doesn't find blocks.

##  PPS (Pay-Per-Share) Payment Model

Pay-Per-Share, or PPS, is a payment model that guarantees miners a fixed reward for each valid share they submit, regardless of whether the pool successfully mines a block. This model offers more predictable and stable income for miners, as they receive compensation for their work regularly.

PPS, however, shifts the risk of variance from miners to the pool operator, who must absorb the impact of fluctuations in block discovery. While it provides stability for miners, the fixed payout may be lower compared to proportional models during periods of high block discovery.

## PPNL (Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares) Payment Model

Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares, or PPNL, is a variation of the PPS model. In PPNL, miners are rewarded based on the number of shares they submit, with an emphasis on the most recent shares. This approach aims to reduce the impact of stale shares, optimizing rewards for miners actively contributing to the pool.

PPNL seeks to strike a balance between the predictability of PPS and the potential for increased earnings during periods of high mining activity. Miners receive compensation for their most recent efforts, aligning incentives with current pool performance.

## DPPS (Double Geometric Payout System) Payment Model

The Double Geometric Payout System, or DPPS, is a hybrid model that combines elements of both proportional and PPS models. DPPS aims to provide stability while also offering the potential for increased earnings during periods of high mining activity.

DPPS achieves this by using a geometric reward system, where miners receive a base payout for each share and additional bonuses based on the overall pool performance. This model attempts to balance the predictability of PPS with the flexibility of proportional payouts.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right mining pool payment model depends on a miner's risk tolerance, computational power, and preferences for stable or variable income. Each model has its advantages and drawbacks, and miners should carefully consider their options based on their individual circumstances. As the cryptocurrency mining landscape continues to evolve, new payment models may emerge, providing miners with even more choices for optimizing their earnings.
